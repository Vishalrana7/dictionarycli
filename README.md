Trie (also known as prefix tree) is a tree-based data structure that is used to store an associative array where the keys are sequences (usually strings). Some advantages of using a trie data structure include:
Fast search: Tries support fast search operations, as we can search for a key by traversing down the tree from the root, and the search time is directly proportional to the length of the key. This makes tries an efficient data structure for searching for keys in a large dataset.
Space-efficient: Tries are space-efficient because they store only the characters that are present in the keys, and not the entire key itself. This makes tries an ideal data structure for storing large dictionaries or lexicons.
Auto-complete: Tries are widely used in applications that require auto-complete functionality, such as search engines or predictive text input.
Efficient insertion and deletion: Tries support fast insertion and deletion of keys, as we can simply add or delete nodes from the tree as needed.
Efficient sorting: Tries can be used to sort a large dataset efficiently, as they support fast search and insertion operations.
Compact representation: Tries provide a compact representation of a large dataset, as they store only the characters that are present in the keys. This makes them an ideal data structure for storing large dictionaries or lexicons.

As I started Learning Data-Structure again now with practical side working on this project give me good insight about this.
